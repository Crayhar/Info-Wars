      One ordinary summer day, a man takes a swimming trip with some of his
      friends.
    </p>

    <p>
      On the walk there a friend yelled “Last one there is a rotten egg!”. A race had begun. A friendly competition to get to the water first
    </p>

    <p>
      Wanting to not be a rotten egg, the man ran ahead of his friends and dove
      in, as he had done many times before.
    </p>

    <p>Suddenly everything was black.</p>

    <p>
      His friends stood confused as they saw his seemingly lifeless body float
      up to the surface.
    </p>

    <p>
      The next thing he knew, he was in the hospital, unable to move more than
      his head.

      This is what happened to Noland Arbaugh in 2016. After diving in the water
      he hit his head hard on something under the water, causing paralysis from
      the neck down. Being unable to move his body he had to return home to his
      parents and start living there again. Having recently started college and
      embracing his new-found freedom it was a terrible strike for Arbaugh to
      have it taken away again.

    <p>
      However, a savior came to Arbaugh's rescue by the name of Neuralink. In
      late 2023 they were ready to give the neuralink to people for the first
      time. Arbaugh heard about it through a friend and found out that he might
      be the first person ever to have a neuralink. He was very apprehensive at
      first. It was very experimental, and even neuralink themselves were unsure
      if it would even work. Arbaugh was thinking things like “maybe someone
      else can do this first, and I can get the better version.” Eventually he
      decided to go through with it anyway, even if he knew it might not work.
    </p>

    <p>
      Fortunately for Arbaugh it was a success! He was still far away from being
      a walking cyborg, but now he could control computers through his neuralink
      by making his hand be the mouse cursor. When he thought about moving his
      arm forward, the cursor moved upward. And when he tapped with a finger the
      cursor clicked. He may still not be able to take a shower on his own, but
      now he can browse the web completely independently and thus can continue
      his education and possibly find a job, something he thought was impossible
      for him now.
