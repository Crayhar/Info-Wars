                    One ordinary summer day, a man takes a swimming trip with some of his
                    friends.

                    On the walk there a friend yelled “Last one there is a rotten egg!”. A race had begun. A friendly competition to get to the water first

                    Wanting to not be a rotten egg, the man ran ahead of his friends and dove
                    in, as he had done many times before.

          This is what happened to Noland Arbaugh in 2016. After diving in the water
          he hit his head hard on something under the water, causing paralysis from
          the neck down.

        <h1>The Neuralink changed this man’s life, can it change others too?</h1>
        <p>Written by Jonas Hagen Aronsen</p>
        
        <hr>

        <p>  
          Being unable to move his body he had to return home to his
          parents and start living there again. Having recently started college and
          embracing his new-found freedom it was a terrible strike for Arbaugh to
          have it taken away again.
        </p>

        <p>
          However, a savior came to Arbaugh's rescue by the name of Neuralink. In
          late 2023 they were ready to give the neuralink to people for the first
          time. Arbaugh heard about it through a friend and found out that he might
          be the first person ever to have a neuralink. 
        </p>

          He was very apprehensive at first. It was very experimental, and even neuralink 
          themselves were unsure if it would even work. Arbaugh was thinking things like “maybe someone
          else can do this first, and I can get the better version.” Eventually he
          decided to go through with it anyway, even if he knew it might not work.
        </p>

        <p>
          Fortunately for Arbaugh it was a success! He was still far away from being
          a walking cyborg, but now he could control computers through his neuralink
          by making his hand be the mouse cursor. 
        </p>

        <p>
          When he thought about moving his
          arm forward, the cursor moved upward. And when he tapped with a finger the
          cursor clicked. 
        </p>
        <p>
          He may still not be able to take a shower on his own, but
          now he can browse the web completely independently and thus can continue
          his education and possibly find a job, something he thought was impossible
          for him now.
        </p>
        <br>

        <p>This technology might still be in it's early stages, but through the help of more volunteers and more time it 
            can truly become something extraordinary for the entire world. </p>
            
        <p>According to <a href="https://www.who.int/health-topics/disability#tab=tab_1">WHO</a>,
            1.3 billion people in the world are considered disabled.</p>
            
        <p>This ranges from down syndrome, to autism and from diabetes to a spinal chord injury.</p>
            
        <p>Given the wide range of what is considered a disability it makes it hard to define 
            exactly how many people could benefit from a neuralink. </p>
        <p>However, if we were to assume that just 0.1% of people with a disability 
            would benefit from a neuralink, that would still be 1.3 million people. </p>
