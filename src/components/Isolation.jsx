                        Before COVID-19, online gaming was steadily growing but often viewed as a niche activity. Titles like Minecraft and Fortnite were popular but primarily seen as

                    <p>
                        Games like Among Us were largely unknown, with small communities of dedicated players. However, the pandemic 
                        redefined this perception, bringing gaming into the mainstream as a way to forge bonds and bridge the gap of physical distance.
