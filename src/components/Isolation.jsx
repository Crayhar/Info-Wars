                        When COVID-19 forced the world into lockdown, online gaming experienced an unprecedented surge, offering an essential outlet for connection and entertainment.

                        According to <a href="https://www.statista.com/statistics/746230/fortnite-players/">Statista</a>, popular games like Fortnite saw their player count double as millions
                        turned to virtual spaces to fill the void left by traditional social 
                        interactions. For many, online gaming became more than just a pastime‚Äîit was a way to stay mentally healthy, maintain relationships, and cope with the isolation.

                        Before COVID-19, online gaming was steadily growing but often viewed as a niche activity. Titles like Minecraft and Fortnite were popular but primarily seen as 
                        entertainment rather than tools for social connection. Games like Among Us were largely unknown, with small communities of dedicated players. However, the pandemic 
                        redefined this perception, bringing gaming into the mainstream as a way to forge bonds and bridge the gap of physical distance.
